These tapes can withstand the rigorous overhang taping operation through sharp bends and curves without loosing their insulation value. They can be supplied in two different insulation classes. Class H insulation uses only the high thermal-grade silicone resin or modified polyester resin as a binder, whereas Class F insulation uses an epoxy resin as a binder.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLess space constraints give way to a thicker insulation for the coil overhangs. An additional fourth layer of PET film may also be laminated on the glass cloth side.

Rope and rope packing are insulation materials that are used to seal and protect boilers, pipes and heaters from fire.\r\n\r\nSynonyms of product\r\nAsbestos Rubber Sheets\r\nLeveraging on our industrious experience, we offer asbestos braided ropes in standard as well as in customer specific options. These are manufactured using white Chrysotile yarn twisted around in m/c. We make use of our finest quality asbestos yarn. These Asbestos rope is also known as Asbestos cord, line, cable, lead, twine, string.\r\n\r\nAsbestos ropes are widely used in the heavy machinery industry in the processes of heat insulation of pipes and boiler sealing, hot blast valves, blue cap doors. They can be effectively used in applications with temperature up to 350 degree Celsius beyond which it starts to crumble. Moreover, these are widely acknowledged for their higher efficiency, low cost maintenance and consistent output.\r\n\r\nProduct wise application search strings\r\nIt was commonly used to make fire retardant blankets, oven mitts, ironing board covers and gaskets for boilers.",

Due to their high temperature-resistance and good technical properties (i.e. good thermal shock resistance and low thermal conductivity), they quickly became the reference for industrial high temperature insulation."

   productDescription:"PTFE (Polytetra-fluoro-ethylene) is a synthetic fluoropolymer accidentally invented by Roy Plunkett that finds numerous applications. It is well known by the DuPont brand name Teflon. PTFE is a material of remarkable properties; non-stick, friction-free, self-lubricating, non-wetting, non-flammable, non-brittle, non-toxic, resistant to atmospheric conditions, resistant to fungus growth and resistant to all chemicals (except molten alkali metals and fluorine at elevated temperatures and pressures). Its electrical properties are equally outstanding. All properties are maintained over a wide working temperature range of -200oC to +350oC.Fiber-Glass too is a material of remarkable properties. Fabrics made from continuous filament yarn exhibit superior properties in terms of high tensile strength, low elongation, high temperature resistance, electric and sound insulation etc.Back in 1980 Unnati, having received technical support from DuPont, was one of the first companies in India to develop a matrix of the two materials - PTFE + Fiberglass i.e. PTFE coated Glass Cloth. Although not the first to develop we are now by far, the largest manufacturer. Various varieties are made on our towers which are the most sophisticated in the country. Should the end application demand colourful fabrics - we have them. Controlled manufacturing processes and rigid inspection procedures give the right quality of the material that is capable of resolving a wide range of problems. Conductive grades of fabrics are also our specialty where the static & charge needs to be handled carefully.Requirements to cover Antennas at high altitudes have been successfully matched with PTFE coated fiber glass fabrics used as Radomes. Special grades have been developed which allows micro-waves to pass through. They protect the Antennas from snow, dust, rain, moisture, bird nest etc. We offer a wider range of PTFE products than any other manufacturer, including PTFE coated Glass Fabric in sheets, rolls, tapes, discs, laminates, belts and threads."

Even though the base kraft paper is impregnated with liquids to manufacture creped kraft paper, the porosity of the paper remains intact due to the automatic temperature and moisture control by the automated machine. The mechanical, as well as cross mechanical strength, is enhanced as compared to the base kraft paper. The pH value remains intact, a little more towards acidic as preferred in transformer insulation. The BDV is enhanced by up to 80% as compared to base kraft paper. To ensure of the best quality of Crepe paper, the base kraft paper is manufactured using longer fibers of pure wood pulp. This base paper is chemically neutral with low ash, chloride and sulfide content."
